# ðŸ‘‹Hello,
## my name is Gustavo Peretti.
```

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Dairy Cattle Veterinarian:cow: and 
ðŸŒ± I recently learned FullStack Developer skills at #SoyHenry.
Now I have tech skills in JavaScript, Express, Sequelize, React, Redux, and more.

Being a Vet has taught me about responsibility, teamwork, the scientific method, diagnosis, and prioritization. 
As I have always been a logical thinker, my friends and my brother recommended that I learn about programming. They suggested I try out SoyHenry, and I took a chance.
***I never thought that this new world could be so thrilling. This program not only gave me knowledge about software programming, but also introduced me to new friends, boosted my self-confidence, and provided me with a new perspective.***
